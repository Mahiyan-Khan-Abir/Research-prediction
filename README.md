# Research-prediction
The prediction is based on various parameters which are used to predict whether a student is going to be successful in research or not
The data is consists of classification values. However, the output data is in Descrete (Binary in this case). So I have used classification algorithms to predict the dependent variable.
The Algorithms used are: 
1. K-Neighbors Classifier (KNN)
2. Support Vector Classifier
3. Decision Tree Classifier
4.Ensemble method ( K-Neighbors Classifier + Support Vector Classifier + Decision Tree Classifier )
